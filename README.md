# SQL-Practical-Course

## This document helps to understand SQL basics
I’ve created those projects based on the academy exercises during my education. 
The idea is playing more deeply with SQL, looking for different workarounds and solving problems to myself for precising my coursework which is under progress, and     to apply them into real job-case scenarios.
I’m preparing few more projects and would gladly accept guidelines from others for improving and developing or ways to make the codes more efficient and optimized.

## My SQL Projects Examples
